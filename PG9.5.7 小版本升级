小版本升级数据库后对现有的database需要进行如下操作

1 Restart the postmaster after adding allow_system_table_mods = true to postgresql.conf.

2 In each database of the cluster, run the following commands as superuser:

SET search_path = pg_catalog;
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW pg_user_mappings AS
    SELECT
        U.oid       AS umid,
        S.oid       AS srvid,
        S.srvname   AS srvname,
        U.umuser    AS umuser,
        CASE WHEN U.umuser = 0 THEN
            'public'
        ELSE
            A.rolname
        END AS usename,
        CASE WHEN (U.umuser <> 0 AND A.rolname = current_user)
                    OR (U.umuser = 0 AND pg_has_role(S.srvowner, 'USAGE'))
                    OR (SELECT rolsuper FROM pg_authid WHERE rolname = current_user)
                    THEN U.umoptions
                 ELSE NULL END AS umoptions
    FROM pg_user_mapping U
         LEFT JOIN pg_authid A ON (A.oid = U.umuser) JOIN
        pg_foreign_server S ON (U.umserver = S.oid);
        
3 template0 and template1 databases

ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true;

and then after fixing template0, undo that with

ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false;

4 Finally, remove the allow_system_table_mods configuration setting, and again restart the postmaster.
